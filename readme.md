# cstimer-analyse _WIP_

> A ruby script to analyse your cstimer output for you and give you insights on your solve times

What kinds of insights?

- [x] Evolution of your averages of 12, 50, 100 and 1000s.
- [ ] Time distribution over a very specific range of solve times
	* A distribution of 20-25 second solves with an increment of 0.5 seconds
	* A distribution of your best solves for each 100 solves and their increment over time
- [ ] Graphs and histograms for all kinds of stuff! (if the times had been timestamped in csTimer!)
- [ ] Some kind of a scatterplot
	* Frequency on the y-axis and the time on the x-axis, or time range? Not sure. TODO.
